# State Estimation
- State estimation - Using noisy sensor data to estimate a robot's position, velocity, or orientation.

- Least squares is optimal under normally distributed errors.

- Kalman filter - Estimating a system’s state in the presence of measurement noise.

- Types of sensors:
	- Interoceptive - A sensor that takes a measurment of something inside itself.
		- Accelerometer, gyroscope, odometer.
	- Exteroceptive - A sensor that takes a measurment of something outside itself.
		- Camera, GPS, lazer range finder.
