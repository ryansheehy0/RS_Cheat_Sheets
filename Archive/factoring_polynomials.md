# Factoring Polynomials

$x^2 + (a+b)x + a*b = (x + a)(x + b)$
- The leading coefficient is the value in front of $x^2$
- The constant term is $a * b$

## Leading coefficient is 1
1. List out factors of the constant term
2. Add each of the factors up to see if one equals $a+b$
3. Construct factors from formula.
4. Find the values that set each factor to 0.

Example: $x^2 + 5x - 6$

1. $-6$ and $1$,  $6$ and $-1$, etc.
2. The factors $6$ and $-1$ add up to $5$
3. $(x + 6)(x - 1)$
4. $x = -6$ and $1$

## Leading coefficient isn't 1
1. Multiply the leading coefficient and the constant term
2. List out the factors of this result
3. Find the factors that add up to $a+b$
4. Construct factors from formula.
5. Divide the numbers by the leading coefficient.
6. Simplify the fractions.
7. Move the denominator in front of x for each factor.

Example: $10x^2 + 7x - 6$

1. $10 * -6 = -60$
2. $10$ and $-6$, $-5$ and $12$, etc.
3. $-5 + 12 = 7$
4. $(x - 5)(x + 12)$
5. $(x - \frac{5}{10})(x + \frac{12}{10})$
6. $(x - \frac{1}{2})(x + \frac{6}{5})$
7. $(2x - 1)(5x + 6)$

## Cubes

$A^3 + B^3 = (A+B)(A^2 - AB + B^2)$

Example: $x^3 + 8 = x^3 + 2^3 = (x+2)(x^2 - 2x + 4)$
