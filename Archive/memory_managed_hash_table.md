# Memory Managed Hash Table
- Arrays are slow to find an element (Linear search or binary search), but they only store the data that they need.
- Hash tables are quick to find an element because you can calculate the index from the element you are searching for, but they take up more memory then is needed.
- What if you could put the data in an array(low memory) and encode the position of that data in an equation. Then when retrieving that data you just have to run the equation(fast finding) to get the exact position.
	- Low memory and fast finding, like a memory managed hash table.

- What if this equation is like a ball rolling into a valley.
- The equation minimizes the energy

- Start out with physics equations for a ball rolling down a hill instead of hopfield networks.
	- Start from first principles

- Lagrange equations for a ball rolling down a hill because it conserves energy.

- Start off with 1 input and 1 output.
	- Could the evolutionary algorithm help with this problem.
