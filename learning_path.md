- Books
	- "State Estimation for Robotics" by Timothy Barfoot
	- "Digital signal processing using the ARM Cortex M4" by Donald S. Reay
	- "Real-time Systems: Design Principles for Distributed Embedded Applications" by Hermann Kopetz
	- "Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers" by Karl J. Astrom and Richard
	- "C++ in Embedded Systems: A practical transition from C to modern C++" by Amar Mahmutbegovic

- Why C++ for embedded
	- Classes, overloading methods, and RAII(destructor automatically runs when obj out of scope.)
	- `#progma once` instead of `#ifndef`
	- `constexpr` instead of `#define`
	- Templates
	- Enum class insead of enums
	- Compile time checks
	- Better casts. Easier to search for.
	- Binary literals(`0b0101`)
	- Digit separators(`123'456`)
