## [Point plotting](#basic-graphing)
Point plotting is plotting points until the shape of the function is apparent.
- If you don't plot enough points you risk misinterpreting the graph.

**Intercepts** are points that have 0 as either the X or Y coordinates.
- X-intercepts are points that lie on the x-axis, so Y coordinate is 0.
- Y-intercepts are points that lie on the y-axis, so X coordinate is 0.

Knowing the **symmetry** of a graph can cut the amount of points you need by half.
- Symmetry around the **y-axis** where (X, Y) equals (-X, Y)
- Symmetry around the **x-axis** where (X, Y) equals (X, -Y)
- Symmetry around the **origin** where (X, Y) equals (-X, -Y)
In order to test for symmetry, replace your function's X and/or Y with the corresponding -X and/or -Y for the symmetry you are checking and see if the functions are equal. If they are equal, it is symmetrical around that axis.

1. Find X and Y intersections
2. Test symmetries
3. Plot points

## [Common equations and their graphs](#basic-graphing)

### [Lines](#basic-graphing)

$slope = m = \frac{rise}{run} = \frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$

- Positive slope: `/`, negative slope: `\`, zero slope: `_`, undefined slope: `|`

| Form Name       | Equation               |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Point Slope     | $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$ |
| Slope Intercept | $y = mx + b$           |
| General         | $ax + by + c= 0$       |
| Vertical line   | x = a                  |
| Horizontal line | y = a                  |

**Parallel** - two lines have the same slope. $m_1 = m_2$

**Perpendicular** - two lines have negative reciprocals as slopes. $m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}$

- For the slope intercept form, the Y-intercept is (0, b).


## [Shifting Origin](#basic-graphing)

$f(x - a)$ shifts the graph along the X-axis $a$ positions positive(to the right).

$f(x) + b$ shifts the graph along the Y-axis $b$ positions positive(upwards).

## [Squeezing](#basic-graphing)

$f(ax)$ squeezes $f(x)$ by a factor of $a$

$f(\frac{x}{a})$ stretches $f(x)$ by a factor of $a$

## [Quadratic Equation](#basic-graphing)

$a x^2 + b x + c$

| Variable | Description                                                                                                                             |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $a$      | $\|a\| > 1$ parabola narrower, $\|a\| < 1$ parabola wider, $a$ positive `/\`, and $a$ negative `\/`                                     |
| $b$      | $a$ positive and ($b$ positive left down or $b$ negative right down). $a$ negative and ($b$ positive right up or $b$ negative left up). |
| $c$      | $c$ positive shift upwards and $c$ negative shift down.                                                                                 |

## [Trigonometry Functions](#basic-graphing)

$sin(x)$ starts at (0,0), peaks upwards($y = 1$) at $\frac{pi}{2}$, and is 0 at $pi$

$cos(x)$ starts at (0,1), peaks downwards($y = -1$) at $\frac{pi}{2}$, and is 0 at $pi$

## [Square root](#basic-graphing)

## [Points of intersection](#basic-graphing)
- A point that satisfies both equations.
1. Make sure both equations equal Y
2. Set both equations equal to each other
3. Solve for X
4. Find the corresponding Y coordinates for the X coordinates.
